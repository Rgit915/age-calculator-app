## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

## What You’ll Learn


- **React State Management**: Managing and updating component state using React’s `useState` hook.
- **Component Communication**: Passing data and functions between components using props and handling events.
- **Component Design**: Building functional components and separating concerns.
- **Date Manipulation**: Handling and calculating dates using JavaScript.
- **Date Validation**: Validating user input to ensure a valid date is provided.
- **Utility Functions**: Implementing utility functions to perform specific tasks like age calculation.
- **React Basics**: Working with JSX, component structure, and rendering dynamic content.


### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to further explore:

- Incorporating animations and transitions for a more interactive user experience.

### Useful Resources

- [React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - The official React documentation is always my go-to resource for understanding React concepts and best practices.
- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - The Tailwind CSS documentation provides comprehensive guidance on using Tailwind's utility classes effectively.
